title: "Batch Exploration with Examples for Scalable Robotic Reinforcement Learning"
collection: research
permalink: /research/2021-bee
excerpt: 'We propose a framework for leveraging weak human supervision to enable better robotic exploration for scalable data collection. Using just a few minutes of human supervision, the robot autonomously collects high quality data while unsupervised, providing better data for downstream offline RL.'
