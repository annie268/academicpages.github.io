permalink: 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11917'
excerpt: 'We propose a framework for leveraging weak human supervision to enable better robotic exploration for scalable data collection. Using just a few minutes of human supervision, the robot autonomously collects high quality data while unsupervised, providing better data for downstream offline RL.'
