excerpt: 'Annie S. Chen, Suraj Nair, Chelsea Finn
We propose a simple approach, Domain-agnostic Video Discriminator (DVD), that learns multitask reward functions by training a discriminator to classify whether two videos are performing the same task. These reward functions can generalize to unseen environments and tasks by learning from a small amount of robot data and a large, diverse dataset of in-the-wild human videos.'
