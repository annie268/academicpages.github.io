excerpt: 'Annie S. Chen*, Hyunji Nam*, Suraj Nair*, Chelsea Finn
We propose a framework for leveraging weak human supervision to enable better robotic exploration for scalable data collection. Under this framework, the robot autonomously collects high quality data with a few minutes of human supervision, providing better data for downstream offline RL.'
