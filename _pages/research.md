<span style="color:CornflowerBlue">[Learning Generalizable Robotic Reward Functions from "In-The-Wild" Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16817.pdf)</span>  
   **Annie S. Chen**, Suraj Nair, Chelsea Finn
   ***Under submission, 2021***
   <sup>We propose a simple approach, Domain-agnostic Video Discriminator (DVD), that learns multitask reward functions by training a discriminator to classify whether two videos are performing the same task. These reward functions can generalize to unseen environments and tasks by learning from a small amount of robot data and a large, diverse dataset of in-the-wild human videos.</sup>

   **Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) & International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2021***
   <sup>We propose a framework for leveraging weak human supervision to enable better robotic exploration for scalable data collection. Under this framework, the robot autonomously collects high quality data with a few minutes of human supervision, providing better data for downstream offline RL.</sup>
