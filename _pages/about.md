Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in math and completing a coterminal masterâ€™s program in computer science. I will be a first-year computer science PhD student at Stanford University this fall, affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I am excited by problems in and at the intersection of robot learning, reinforcement learning, and robustness. My research aims to develop scalable methods to build broadly intelligent robotic agents that require minimal human supervision. I will be generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship starting this fall.  

I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and my mentor [Suraj Nair](https://cs.stanford.edu/~surajn/) in the IRIS lab. Before starting my PhD, I will be interning at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) this summer with [Pete Florence](http://www.peteflorence.com/). I am originally from Boulder, CO, and outside of research, I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, and learning to play the guitar.
