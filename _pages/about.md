Hi! I am an incoming computer science PhD student at Stanford University, affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/). I am generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

I am broadly interested in robot learning and robustness. My research aims to develop scalable methods to build broadly intelligent robotic agents that require minimal human supervision. I plan to receive my B.S. in Mathematics and M.S. in Computer Science together in June 2021, also from Stanford.
