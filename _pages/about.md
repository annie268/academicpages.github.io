<!--Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in math and completing a coterminal masterâ€™s program in computer science. I will be a first-year computer science PhD student at Stanford University this fall, affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I am excited by problems at the intersection of robot learning, reinforcement learning, and robustness. My research aims to develop scalable methods to build broadly intelligent robotic agents that require minimal human supervision. I will be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship starting this fall.  -->

<!--I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and mentor [Suraj Nair](https://cs.stanford.edu/~surajn/). Before starting my PhD, I will be interning at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) this summer with [Pete Florence](http://www.peteflorence.com/). I am originally from Boulder, Colorado, and outside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing tennis, card games, and learning to play the guitar. at the intersection of reinforcement learning and robustness -->

Hi! I am a second-year computer science PhD student at Stanford University advised by Prof. [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/). My research aims to develop scalable methods to build broadly intelligent agents that require minimal human supervision. I am excited by problems involving interesting distributional shifts in both reinforcement learning and supervised learning and work to develop models that can generalize or adapt to changing environments. I am supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).  

Previously, I received a B.S. in math and M.S. in computer science, both also at Stanford. I have also been a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), where I learned a lot working with [Pete Florence](http://www.peteflorence.com/). 

I am originally from Boulder, Colorado, and outside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing tennis, and learning to play the guitar. I care about creating an inclusive research culture and co-organize the [Stanford CS Undergraduate Mentoring Program](https://stanfordcsmentoring.wordpress.com/), which matches undergraduate students with graduate student mentors and aims to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in CS.
