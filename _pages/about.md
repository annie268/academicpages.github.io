Hi! I am an incoming computer science PhD student at Stanford University, affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/). I am excited by problems in and at the intersection of robot learning, reinforcement learning, and robustness. My research aims to develop scalable methods to build broadly intelligent robotic agents that require minimal human supervision. I am generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.  

I plan to receive my B.S. in Mathematics and M.S. in Computer Science together in June 2021, also from Stanford. I plan to intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) this summer with [Pete Florence](http://www.peteflorence.com/). I am originally from Boulder, CO, and outside of research, I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, and learning to play the guitar.
